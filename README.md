Simple python tool for post-processing of a wave signal from an arbitrary source (measurements, numerics, etc.). The purpose of this repository is  based on a) scarcity of open-source tools for such operations b) the reconstruction is not as straightforward as you might expect from the literature in ocean engineering. Currently, JONSWAP spectrum is used for synthetic wave series so adjust accordingly to your needs.
